# rust_d3_geo_voronoi

This is a port of the [d3-geo](https://github.com/d3/d3-geo_voronoi) library into a RUST library crate/package. It is in a very early development phase.

## Phase 1

Early draft port - sub module by submodule. Sub module porting means the test have also been ported.
No API stability guarentees.

delaunay first then  voronoi.

## Phase 2

API finialization. There maybe optimisation in the area of generics. So the API only gets locked down in phase 2.
 The code will be profiled and bottlenecks identified.

Modules, passing test ready for phase 2 evaluation :-
